# Depreciated
This project has not been touched since 2014. iOS 8 presented a more obfuscated framework to play with as Apple began trying to strip useful symbols from their private frameworks. Coupled with the difficulty in keeping iOS jailbroken for community hacks/enhancements there was no more interest to continue this.

# NoAccSplash
This MobileSubstrate Extension removes the Accessory Connected splash screen from the iPod/Music/Video applications to allow playback controls to be accessed.

## Motivation
Had a desire to see the artwork of whatever song I had playing as my wallpaper on my iPhone. This tweak is the result of that desire.

## Features
* Displays artwork of the currently playing song on the home screen.
